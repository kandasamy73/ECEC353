-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Notice the real time (wallclock time) is about the same as 03-pc_cv, but
the user time (non-kernel CPU time) is about 48x larger.  Kernel time is about
the same for both versions.  This is because the consumer thread never yields
the CPU by blocking for the condition variable.
